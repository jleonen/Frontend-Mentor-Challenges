## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned more about how to toggle between classes using Javascript. So it allowed me to work with manipulating class names of certain elements with Javascript. It was also a good opportunity for me to practice using CSS grid. I learned how to apply a linear gradient on the top border of an element as well as how to apply a style to a checkbox once it's been clicked.

### Continued development

I will need to study more about what webkit properties do, as that was one of the properties used to make the button in this project. I would also like to have more opportunities to work with checkboxes and how to apply styles to them as well.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog) - This is the youtube video that I followed along with to make the button that toggles between dark and light mode in this project.
