## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about how to make a pop up nav when pressing on a button. I learned more about using linear gradients when styling the invite button. I had the chance to work more with utilizing z-indexes to position the background in the intro section.

### Continued development

There are some challenges that I have faced while doing this challenge. One challenge is how to darken the background when the nav shows up. Another challenge is changing the color of the easybank icon in the footer section. I believe that the website could have been styled better. I think there could have been shorter and easier methods to use to style this website.

### Useful resources

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) - I used code from udemy lesson to make the nav button when screen is around 500px.
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/stilllife00/pen/avXpgJ?css-preprocessor=postcss) - This is the codepen that I went to in order to get the filter for the icons.
