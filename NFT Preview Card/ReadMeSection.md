## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I mainly took on this small project to get used to working with rem units since I am more currently accustomed to working with pixel units. This was also good practice with learning how to position/layout elements more efficiently.

### Continued development

I would like to work with using rem units more when adding sizes for elements.

### Helpful resources
